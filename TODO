TODO list (not prioritized):

* Implement configuration file
  The configuration file defines files which contain
  - assymetry
  - spreading rates
  - timescale (if not Cande & Kent's timescale)
  - jumps
  - magnetization
  - parameters
  
  The configuration file is a some sort of a project file


* Implement graph controls
  Make it possible to choose which graphs are plotted and
  what to plot instead of a default plot of bathymetry and
  anomalies


* Implement magnetization file
  The magnetization file is similar to the jump, assymetry
  and spreading rate files.


* Implement parameter file
  The parameter file includes parameters which are constants
  but can be changed. A global parameter file should be used
  by default, similar to the Cande & Kent timescale but one
  should be able to overwrite them


* Implement model
  The model is a theoretical calculation for anomalies and is
  the main objective of magellan.


* Compute azimuth
  Create a function which computes the azimuth from longditudes
  and latitudes.


* Plot failed rifts and pseudo faults
  Currently magellan marks pseudo faults and failed rifts but
  does not plot them. Add lines to indicate where they are into
  the plot
