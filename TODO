TODO list (not prioritized):

* Implement graph controls
  Make it possible to choose which graphs are plotted and
  what to plot instead of a default plot of bathymetry and
  anomalies

* Finish implementing model
  The model is a theoretical calculation for anomalies and is
  the main objective of magellan. Currently it does not use
  the magnetic layer and needs some fixing regarding computing
  azimuth, reading magnetization, inclination and so forth.
  Current version is using dummy values.


* Compute azimuth
  Create a function which computes the azimuth from longditudes
  and latitudes.
