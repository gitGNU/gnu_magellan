<H2>1. General Overview </H2>
<p>
Magellan is based on Talwani's (1959) method of 2-D bodies. This method both applies for gravity and magnetic modeling, but Magellan only deals with the magnetic part of the method.
</p>

<p>
The basics of the method is that the oceanic floor is assumed to be a set of parallelepipeds that extend infinitely along the ridge, where seafloor spreading is taking place (fig 1).  This assumption reduces a 3-D problem into a 2-D problem, making it easier to solve. Here we use a right-handed (positive) cartesian coordinate system where the ridge extends infinitely along the y-axis and positive z-axis is down. Henceforth the depth that is measured is positive. Also, the shiptracks are generally run perpendicular to the ridge, that is along the x-axis. The parallelepipeds are defined by the bathymetry of the oceanic floor and their magnetization is assumed to be homogeneous (that is not directionally dependent).

The thickness of the magnitized layer is by default 500m but the user has the freedom to change it.
