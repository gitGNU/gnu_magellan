<h1>Magellan</h1>

<p>
Magellan is based on the similar projects magbath and MODMAG. The two aforementioned projects are not free software so magellan is their free software counterpart.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, magellan is meant to enable users, both researchers and programmers to more easily modify source code and improve the software. Python was chosen as the programming language to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
</p>

<p>
The user interface is designed to enable better control and input of parameters and data, without any boundaries, through the use of commandline and input plain text files.

<h2>Magellan developer site</h2>

Development of Magellan is organized through the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/magellan/">Savannah</a> repository.
